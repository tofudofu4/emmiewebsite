        <p>Man I fucking miss you, but I hope this website is a remind of our memories that we've made just over the summer, and to know that they weren't just in person but over text too. im sad as fuck but I also can't help but have hope becvause ik how much we mean to each other, and honestly all I can do is have hope, because i really fucking want this to wokr and i want you in my fucking life. But I hope above all, we can stay grounded in what this friendship is, and that its based on this mutual love and care for each other thats based in this emotional support for each other. We got so close because we realized how similar we were and how much we could relate to each other, and we bonded being able to be vulnerable and support each other through it. I also really love you for how much you inspire me everyday, your fire and life drive me to be my best everyday. None of this has to do with in person interaction, and so I hope this can give us hope :D</p>
